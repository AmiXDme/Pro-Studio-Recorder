## 🎨 Creative Guidelines

When contributing to the UI/UX:
- **Aesthetics First**: Use modern, clean components.
- **Glassmorphism**: When adding new cards or panels, use subtle transparencies and blurs.
- **Micro-interactions**: Add hover effects and smooth transitions for all interactive elements.
- **Consistency**: Stick to the defined CSS variables in `style.css`.

## 🏗️ Technical Standards

- **Python**: Flask 2.0+, Pydub for audio.
- **JavaScript**: ES6+, minimize external dependencies.
- **Documentation**: Update the `README.md` or `ARCHITECTURE.md` if you introduce new system logic.
